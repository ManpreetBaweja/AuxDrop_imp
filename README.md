# AuxDrop_imp
This project implements the AuxDrop-ODL model from the paper:

Rohit Agarwal, Deepak Gupta, Alexander Horsch, Dilip K. Prasad. Aux-Drop: Handling Haphazard Inputs in Online Learning Using Auxiliary Dropouts, arXiv:2303.05155, 2024.

An ODL model that uses auxiliary dropout, is trained on the magic04 dataset to classify gamma-ray signals vs background.
2 base features and 8 Auxiliary features are assumed.
It is evaluated using ROC curves.
